Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies. Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism.","books":{},"videos":{"XHBKM7mBHUM":"the nature of consciousness part 1","0nCzlkeYuW4":"the nature of consciousness part 2","eIDWW2h8A7A":"the web of life part 1","s8aD_Tch-Bg":"the web of life part 2","FFNzr6qrYs0":"the inevitable ecstasy part 1","lgpQ356nNDA":"the inevitable ecstasy part 2","8PtP1ezKLZA":"the world as just so part 1","jV0EDNkxaTA":"the world as just so part 2","wPEjn72J5gE":"the world as self part 1","Xp-nP4CN3uo":"the world as self part 2","YF-fBXd1c2Q":"the world as emptiness part 1","uCxy0t6Pl3w":"the world as emptiness part 2","5hMROXyxpSE":"the cosmic network (full lecture)","0CXqgLIPjwg":"how to get your mind back","DBMyeB7MyZg":"your dark side","jQCNvTujaSc":"using your intuition","c2HAgdLbum8":"how to grow","s42V8BGBvTk":"jesus, his religion","sX21TM6QFTI":"die before you actually die","5ZMNLZzgFzM":"are you ready to die?","LLWuAHMTVes":"how to still the mind | alan watts","Gs8OeuaOHwY":"what to do when you feel lost","eoPbjXJY5DI":"a skilled person lives on 2 levels (the information-bomb!)","Ry94tFG4CIM":"do not think too much -
